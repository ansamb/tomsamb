Warm hands, cold heart?

Yvonne: Hello, I'm Yvonne Archer, this is '6 Minute English' - and thanks to William
for joining me today.
William: You're welcome, Yvonne!
Yvonne: Now, are your hands usually warm or cold?
William: Err – you tell me…
Yvonne: Ooh, you've got warm hands! And that just might explain the type of person
you are. Hmmm…
William: Right, in what way?
Yvonne: I'm not telling you! In today's report, we hear the results of some research into
whether there's any real link between warm hands and a warm heart. But first –
today's big question! William, what's the world's record for the longest time
spent by someone in full body contact in ice? Is it
a) one hour and fifteen minutes
b) one hour and thirty minutes or
c) one hour and fifty minutes
William: Umm – I don't know. I'm going to go for a) – one hour and fifteen minutes.
Yvonne: And how long do you think you'd be able to stay in ice?
William: Umm - what, alive?!
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 2 of 5
Yvonne: Yeah!
William: I – probably about, I don't know, twenty minutes; I'm a bit of a softy.
Yvonne: Yeah – I don't think I could do five minutes actually. But we'll find out
whether your answer is right or wrong at the end of the programme.
Now, we need your help with some of the language, William, that we'll come
across in today's report. First, we'll hear how some people are 'generous in their
judgements'. What does that mean?
William: Well if you're 'generous in your judgement' of somebody, for example – then
your opinion of them is quite nice and quite kind. You're generous in your
judgement of them.
Yvonne: So when I say that you're great company here in the "6 Minute English" studio,
William, am I being generous in my judgement of you?
William: Well – you're being honest! No - you're being very generous in your judgement.
Yes.
Yvonne: Okay. Now what are 'volunteers'?
William: People who aren't paid, but offer their time and their help to do something,
usually for a charity. These are 'volunteers'. For example, I used to be a
volunteer …. . .
Yvonne: Did you?
William: Yeah.
Yvonne: Doing what?
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 3 of 5
William: I worked for the Red Cross as a volunteer for a little while.
Yvonne: Fabulous, so helping people who were ill or injured and so on?
William: Yeah – people who were in need. Yeah.
Yvonne: Excellent. Now in today's report from the BBC's John McGrath, we'll hear how
volunteers were asked to judge people's personalities. But what were the
volunteers asked to hold before they made their judgements?
JOHN MCGRATH
They found that those who had held warm cups of coffee were more likely to be generous in
their judgements than those who had held cups of ice. In a second study, the scientists found
that the volunteers were more likely to give a gift to another person if they had warmed their
hands first.
Yvonne: William, what were the volunteers asked to hold before they judged people's
personalities?
William: Well some were given warm cups of coffee to hold so their hands were warm,
while others were given cups of ice to hold.
Yvonne: Hmmm - and those people with warm hands said nicer things about the
personality of each person they judged. And in the second study – or
experiment – did you happen to catch what the volunteers with warm hands
were more likely to do?
William: Yes, they wanted to give gifts to other people, while those with cold hands
didn't.
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 4 of 5
Yvonne: Aha! So next time you shake hands with someone, you might want to check
whether their hands are warm or cold. If they're warm – there could be a gift
on its way to you!
Now as we know, the words 'warm' and 'cold' are sometimes used to describe
people - even in children's stories. But what do we mean when we use those
terms, William?
William: Well, someone who is a 'warm' person is usually someone who's good, kind,
giving and friendly. But someone who is a 'cold' person is the opposite and
might even be thought of as a bit cruel.
Yvonne: Ooh - but where did that idea come from?
JOHN MCGRATH
The research team say that describing people as either warm or cold, taps into emotions and
experiences that date back to childhood.
Yvonne: William, John used the expression– 'taps into emotions' - so, 'to tap into'. What
did he mean by that?
William: John means that describing people as 'warm' or 'cold' reminds us of feelings
and experiences from our childhood. So for example, most people think of a
mother as a warm person who's kind and good. And that makes us see others
who are physically warm as being kind and good too.
Yvonne: Yes, but psychologists and scientists on the research team have warned us that
this isn't always the case. We can't always know who is good and who is bad
by checking whether their hands are warm or cold. But what we do know is
that our own behaviour and feelings can change depending on whether our own
hands are warm or cold.

William: Well that's it! If a salesman gives me a warm cup of coffee when I go to buy
something, I won't take it.
Yvonne: Why not?
William: Because if my hands are nice and warm, I just might buy something that I don't
really need or want.
Yvonne: That's good thinking! Okay, it's time now to find out the answer to today's big
question, William. What's the world's record for the longest time spent by
someone in full body contact with ice?
William: I said a) - an hour and quarter.
Yvonne: And again…
William: Again? Am I right?
Yvonne: No – no, you were wrong. Sorry. It's actually an hour and a half. It was a man
in China. And yes, he was still alive when they took him out! But that's all
we've got time for on today's "6 Minute English" –

Jargon Busters
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 1 of 5
Yvonne: Hello, this is '6 minute English' - I'm Yvonne Archer…
William: …And I'm William Kremer. Hello!
Yvonne: Thanks for joining me, William! Now today, we're going to do a bit of glossing,
play in few inserts and run a few ideas past you…. Anything to say to that
William?
William: Well - why were you using so much jargon, Yvonne?
Yvonne: Ahh – that's because that's the topic of today's programme! So you'd better
explain what it is for us.
William: Okay - 'jargon' is a noun that we for specific groups of words and expressions.
They're only used by people in special or technical situations because they are
the only people who really understand.
Yvonne: So, for example, 'glossing'…
William: Yes – 'glossing' basically means 'explaining'. So really the only people who
what glossing means are people like you and me, people who teach English
over the radio. So 'glossing' is an example of 'jargon'.
Yvonne: Excellent! Now before we hear more about 'jargon', I've got a question for you
William. Are you ready?
William: No – I'm not ready but I'm feeling brave!
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 2 of 5
Yvonne: That's what I like to hear! Which British Prime Minister became known as
'Jack the Jargon Killer' because he wanted officials to stop using jargon? Was
it
a) Tony Blair
b) Winston Churchill or
c) Robert Peel
William: I don't know the answer to that question but I'm going to go for B – Winston
Churchill because everybody knows thatWinston Churchill loved the English
language and he was a very great speaker so maybe he didn't like jargon.
Yvonne: Good answer, but we'll find out at the programme whether you're right or
wrong. Okay, recently officials were asked to stop using all the jargon that was
written on a list. It contained one hundred different words and expressions – all
jargon that people didn't understand unless they worked with government
officials, for example.
William: Now that sounds like an interesting list. I wonder whether I would understand
any of the jargon on it?
Yvonne: You might, you'll have a chance to find out - however, I need you to explain
some of the language we'll come across in that report today, William. First,
what does 'flagged up' mean?
William: If you 'flag something up', you really want to draw attention to it, you want
people to notice it, so you 'flag it up' – it's a phrasal verb.
Yvonne: And in England, what are 'councils'?
William: 'Councils' are a form of local government - so 'councillors' are local politicians
who people vote for. And elected councillors make decisions about things like
new local buildings and roads.
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 3 of 5
Yvonne: Lovely. Now Paul Ross and Joanne Good from BBC London's Breakfast Show
looked at three pieces of jargon which they found on that list I mentioned. But
do they understand any of the jargon? Try to find out…
PAUL ROSS
What do these phrases mean to you: 'stakeholder engagement'? No, me neither (no). 'A multiagency
approach'? Sort of. And 'a civic amenity site'? The chances are not much – which is
why they've all been flagged up as some of the worst examples of jargon used by councils and
public bodies…
Yvonne: William, did they understand any of the jargon?
William: Well, no – Paul said 'sort of' which means he had an idea what it meant, but he
wasn't sure.
Yvonne: And what about you William – do you know what 'a civic amenity site' is, for
example?
William: Err – not really but I'm guessing it's a really useful place that's used by citizens.
Yvonne: And when you put it like that, it sounds absolutely lovely – but 'a civic amenity
site' is jargon so it's confusing because it could be a wonderful community
centre or a smelly rubbish tip. But are there times when jargon is useful? What
do you think, William?
William: Yes, I think if you don't want other people to understand what you're saying –
but then that's not very nice because it could mean that they don't get really
important information. For example, people can't complain about the building
of a new civic amenity site if they don't know whether it's a good or a bad
thing.
Yvonne: True – and that's why I don't like jargon. But does Joanne agree with me?
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 4 of 5
JOANNE GOOD
In the end, we embrace it, don't we? I mean, jargon is the vernacular, isn't it? And I love being
in the know. I mean, I've been loving this morning's calls because people introduce you into
their shorthand for their workplace…
Yvonne: So Jo believes that after a while, most of us 'embrace' jargon – we get used it,
we begin to like it and we even start using it. But does she actually like it?
William: Yes, she does. She says that she loves jargon because it puts her 'in the know' –
she feels part of a special group of people who understand and use it.
Yvonne: That's right and she even calls jargon 'the vernacular'. But what does she mean
by that, William?
William: 'Vernacular' - she means that it's almost slang – very informal language that's
only used by people who do a particular type of work.
Yvonne: Okay, now without using informal language, William, I need the answer to
today's question! Which British Prime minister became known as 'Jack the
Jargon Killer' because he tried to stop officials using jargon?
William: I said maybe Winston Churchill.
Yvonne: And - you were absolutely… right!
William: Yeah!
Yvonne: Yes! He didn't like things like 'the receipt of your communication is hereby
acknowledged with thanks' - which means?

Aboriginal Cricketer
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 1 of 4
Yvonne: Hello - this is '6 minute English' and I'm Yvonne Archer. And with me today is
the lovely William Kremer. Hello William!
William: Oh hello Yvonne!
Yvonne: Today – a sporting programme as we hear the story of an extraordinary
Australian cricketer. Sadly, he's only just been recognised - thirty years after
his death. But before we find out more, let's get out today's big question!
William, cricket balls have been made from the same materials since the 1700s.
But what colour were they originally?
a) white
b) light brown or
c) cherry red
William: Err…as always, I don't know but I'm gonna go for b) light brown because -
cricket balls are made from leather and lots of leather things are light brown.
So that's my guess – light brown.
Yvonne: Great answer, but are you right or wrong? We'll find out later on. But now,
let's look at some of the language we'll hear in today's report. First, William -
what is meant by 'indigenous Australians'?
William: Well, 'indigenous' people are the original people or native people of a country
or land. So 'indigenous Australians' – who are also known as aboriginals or
aborigines – have always been in Australia. And they were there thousands of
years before Europeans arrived.
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 2 of 4
Yvonne: Can you explain 'indignities'…
William: Yes, 'an indignity' is something that makes us feel embarrassed or humiliates
us and (makes us feel) of little importance. So to give you an example:
prisoners usually have to shower in front of everyone else – and that's one of
the 'indignities' that they have to live with.
Yvonne: And 'slights' or 'a slight' – what's that?
William: 'A slight' is a bit of an old fashioned word and it means a quiet kind of insult.
So, if I give you an example: if I say hello to you Yvonne and you turn your
back and start talking to someone else, well that's a bit of a slight – and in fact,
I can say that you've 'slighted' me.
Yvonne: But of course, I'd never slight you, William. Now in today's report from the
BBC's Nick Bryant, we'll hear about a very talented Australian cricketer who
played many years ago. As you listen, try to find out what two things he
usually needed before he could go and play against white cricketers…
NICK BRYANT
Eddie Gilbert played in the 1930s, when indigenous Australians were confronted with all
kinds of indignities and slights. Even to make the journey to play cricket against white players,
he needed written permission to leave his Aboriginal settlement and was normally chaperoned.
Yvonne: William, what two things did Eddie Gilbert need as an aboriginal cricketer
before he could go and play against white cricketers?
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 3 of 4
William: Well, he needed to have something in writing – he needed 'written permission'
to say that he was allowed to travel to the cricket match. And he was usually
'chaperoned' – so someone with authority had to go with Eddie even though he
was an adult. And so in Eddie's case, the chaperone would have been a white
man.
Yvonne: As we heard, aborigines like Eddie, lived in 'settlements' – areas where they
were forced to stay by the Australian government of the time. But Australian
aborigines during the 1930s were demanding equal rights and to be treated
with dignity.
Now Eddie once bowled and hit the bat right out of the hands of one of the
world's best cricketers - Sir Donald Bradman. So Eddie was the fastest bowler
of the era, but as we'll hear, he never entered the 'pantheon of cricket'. William,
can you explain that term for us?
William: Yes, 'a pantheon' here refers to a special group made up of the world's best
cricketers in this example. And Eddie was never included in that 'pantheon' –
that group of admired and honoured cricketers.
Yvonne: Yeah - it's believed that Eddie's many years of throwing a boomerang – an
Australian type of hunting weapon – was the reason why he could bowl so fast.
And there's another story about Eddie's skills but it might not be true...
NICK BRYANT
Had Eddie Gilbert been born white, he might well have entered the pantheon of cricket but he
never represented his nation. Folklore has it that one of his deliveries burst through a picket
fence and struck a dog with such force that the animal was killed.
William: Oh no – that poor dog!
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 4 of 4
Yvonne: Yes, but remember William, it's only folklore so perhaps the story about the
dog isn't actually true. But thirty years after his death, what we do know to be
true is that Eddie Gilbert was one of the world's greatest cricketers. So at least
they're going to put up a life-size bronze statue in Eddie's home state of
Queensland in his honour.
William: Ahh – so maybe Eddie Gilbert will be remembered in sporting history after all.
Yvonne: Let's hope so. Sadly, Eddie was buried in an unmarked grave so his statue is
very important - especially to aborigines. And now, more people will know the
name Eddie Gilbert.
Right William, today's big question: Cricket balls have been made from the
same materials since the 1700s - but what colour were they originally? And
your answer was…
William: …My answer was light brown – and…
Yvonne: And you were right!
William: Yeah!
Y…. Well done to you. But that's we've got time for in today's "6 Minute English"
from BBC Learning English.

Blind Massage Therapists
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 1 of 4
Yvonne: Hi, I'm Yvonne Archer and this is '6 minute English'. And joining me today is
William Kremer. Hello William!
William: Hello Yvonne!
Yvonne: Now recently, I heard an interesting report about how, in South Korea, only
people who are blind are legally allowed to do a certain type of work.
William: Oh – but what type of work? And is that law fair to everyone else – especially
to people with other types of disability?
Yvonne: Well, they're all good questions William – but before we find out a few
answers, I've got a question for you. Are you ready?
William: As ever…
Yvonne: Good! Approximately how many people in the world are living with a
disability of some kind? Is it
a) two percent
b) ten percent OR
c) twelve percent
William: I don't know but I'm guessing B – ten percent. Because there's a lot of old
people obviously, and old people very often have disabilities of one kind or
another. And there's unfortunately, there're a lot of wars and that leaves people
with a lot of disability. So ten percent…
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 2 of 4
Yvonne: Good answer - ten percent. Okay, we'll find out whether you're right or wrong
at the end of the programme. Since 1963, people in South Korea who are blind
have been the only ones allowed to work as massage therapists. William, what
type of job that?
William: Certainly. A 'massage therapist' is a person who mainly uses their hands and
fingers to rub different areas of the body, head, arms or legs to help stop pain
or to help people move more easily. So someone who's been in an accident, for
example, might have 'massage therapy'.
Yvonne: And people in South Korea, especially those who've recently become blind, are
really happy that the law keeps those jobs for them. But people who aren't
blind want that law changed so that they can also earn money in the same way.
In today's report, we'll come across the expression 'to cope with demand'.
William, what's that mean?
William: Yes, if a person or a company 'copes with demand', they provide what their
customers need when they need it. So for example, a dressmaker who can't sew
all her customers' dresses on time has more work than she can manage and she
can't 'cope with demand'.
Yvonne: Great – and what does 'awash with' mean?
William: 'Awash' literally means covered with water. But here, it means that there's lots
of something. So for example, if you said 'London is awash with tourists in the
summer' it means that there's lots of tourists in London in the summer.
Yvonne: Excellent. Now in his report, the BBC's John Sudworth explains that there are
about seven thousand massage therapists who are blind in South Korea. But
how many people who aren't blind would like to be legal massage therapists
too?
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 3 of 4
JOHN SUDWORTH
There may be seven thousand, but they can't cope with demand. South Korean cities are
awash with massage parlours, barbers' shops and bath houses – all offering massages by
unlicensed, sighted practitioners. An estimated half a million of them in total.
Yvonne: So the cities in South Korea are awash with all kinds of businesses which offer
massages. But William, how many sighted people – people who can see - are
breaking the law by providing those massages?
William: Well, John says that there are about half a million people who are working
illegally – without a licence.
Yvonne: That's right – and they've asked the courts to change the law because they
believe it's unfair to stop them from earning money and it actually makes them
into criminals by doing massages.
Now the massage therapists who are blind aren't happy either…
JOHN SUDWORTH
Now blind masseurs and masseuses have been taking to the streets to defend their monopoly.
Some massage therapists have even jumped off bridges into the Han River.
William: Wow – that's a powerful protest. They really do want to keep their legal right
to be the only group of people who can become massage therapists; they're
desperate to hold onto their 'monopoly'.
Yvonne: They certainly are and luckily, so far, no-one has been seriously hurt in the
protests. Now even though there's more than enough work for everyone, blind
people are worried that this won't always be the case - and say it would be
really difficult for them to find other types of work. But here's a final question
from John which gives us all something else to think about:
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 4 of 4
JOHN SUDWORTH
So is massage work a valuable protection for a vulnerable minority, or a patronising excuse
for a lack of equality?
Yvonne: Hmmm, a question the courts will have to answer. But William, what are your
thoughts - should certain jobs be kept for people with disabilities?
William: Umm…I don't know – that's a very, very difficult question. Umm – maybe.
Maybe that's the fairest thing until everyone can apply for every job. I don't
know.
Yvonne: Well, there's a lot to think about and discuss after the programme. But for now,
let's get the answer to today's question: William, approximately how many
people in the world are living with a disability of some kind?
William: I said ten percent…
Yvonne: You're absolutely right.
William: Yeah!
Yvonne: It's an extraordinary number, isn't it?
William: It is actually. It's a much higher number than a lot of people would think, I
believe.
Yvonne: Anyway, that's all we've time for today – but do join us again next time for

BFM International Film Festival
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 1 of 4
Yvonne: Hello, I'm Yvonne Archer and this is '6 minute English' - and thanks to
William Kremer for joining me today.
William: Hello – it's a pleasure!
Yvonne: For fifty-two years, the Times BFI - British Film Institute's London Film
Festival has shown the best new films from around the world. And for the first
time, the BFM International Film Festival has also been based at the BFI.
William, do you know about the BFM Festival?
William: Umm – I know that it's the Black Film Makers' International Film Festival.
Yvonne: That's right and to celebrate its tenth anniversary, the emphasis of the 2008
BFM has been on films made by Black people - who are based here in Britain.
Well, I was lucky enough to get an invitation to the BFM Shorts Awards - but
before we find out which short film won the award and about the idea behind
this festival – I've a question for you. Yes, are you readyWilliam?
William: Yes.
Yvonne: How long is the shortest film that was ever made? Was it
a) one second
b) one minute OR
c) five minutes
William: I'm gonna go for a) – one second because even though that sounds too short,
sounds very silly, I think the silly answers are usually correct. That's my tactic
so I'm gonna go for one second.
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 2 of 4
Yvonne: ... And we'll find out whether William was right or wrong later on. Now in
today's interview we'll come across the word 'stereotyped'. William, what does
it mean?
William: Well if someone is 'stereotyped', other people who don't know them have a
very strong, fixed idea about how they will behave. They're 'stereotyped'
perhaps because of the country they come from, or (from) the colour of their
skin or their religion, for example.
Yvonne: And what are 'platforms for expression'?
William: 'Platforms for expression' in this case, refers to ways and places that artistic
people can use to share their work and messages. So for example, a cinema
screen or a novel are 'platforms for expression'.
Yvonne: Great! Now as we hear from Nadia Denton, the Director of the BFM
International Film Festival, try to catch the verb she uses to mean 'highlight' or
'to draw attention to'. I asked Nadia: why is there a separate section for Black
film makers within the London Film Festival each year?
NADIA DENTON
Because it's important for us to showcase the stories of groups and communities which
otherwise would go unnoticed, which don't get the correct representation in the mainstream,
who perhaps are stereotyped, who perhaps don't have many other platforms for expression.
Yvonne: William, which verb did Nadia use to mean 'to highlight' or 'to draw attention
to'?
William: 'To showcase' – Nadia explained that it's important 'to showcase' the stories of
communities and groups which we don't usually see or hear.
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 3 of 4
Yvonne: So the BFM Festival is a chance for people who are often stereotyped and not
considered or noticed by mainstream cinema to have their work seen.
Now at the BFM Shorts Awards, we saw five new films and voted for the best
one. And the winner was "Win, Lose or Draw" directed by Lawrence Coke. It
was a wonderful blend of story-telling and interviews with Caribbean people
who'd arrived in Britain from the 1950s, like my own father. And after the
awards, Lawrence explained just how important making the film had been to
him...
LAWRENCE COKE
The whole thing was a very cathartic experience on one level because, I always say that the
young people of today don't understand that they're standing on the shoulders of giants.
Yvonne: Making "Win, Lose or Draw" was very 'cathartic' for Lawrence – it allowed
him to express some really deep emotions. But it was cathartic for many of us
in the audience too – and educational.
William: And hopefully lots of young people will see the film because Lawrence sees it
as a way to help them understand that they and their parents are an important
part of Britain's history.
Yvonne: Yes – and Lawrence describes our grandparents and parents as 'giants'. Their
lives were really difficult but they still tried to help England and make things
easy for us and their families back in the Caribbean.
LAWRENCE COKE
They were children themselves and they came over to help the mother country because they
felt it was the right thing to do – leaving children behind, wives, and… I just…I'm in awe of
that.
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 4 of 4
William: Yes, they were an awesome- amazing group of young people.
Yvonne: They certainly were. My father travelled to England – at the time, known by
Caribbean people as 'the mother country' – and he came here at the age of
twenty-one. And like many others from the Caribbean, my father simply
wanted to work hard and earn money. He wanted his parents to have what they
needed and he especially wanted his younger brothers and sisters to go to
school.
William: So education was really important to them.
Yvonne: Definitely because most of them left school and started work when they were
fourteen years old. But now, it's time for you to educate us, William!
William: Surely not!
Yvonne: Yes!What was your answer to today's question: how long is the shortest film
that was ever made?
William: I went for the silly one which was one second.
Yvonne: And you were correct to be silly because you were absolutely right! Anyway,
that's all for today's "6 Minute English" from BBC Learning English. Join us

Yvonne: Now today's topic is about an extraordinary document which has been kept
secret for more than thirty years but it's now been made public. It's been kept
in a place where other documents and records are kept about Britain's history

b) 850 years ago – or
c) 900 years ago
Callum: I haven't got a clue really so I'm just going to guess at 850 years ago.
Yvonne: Right, whichever answer is right, it was a long time ago! We'll find out later
on.
Now during the 1970s, the British government felt that a nuclear attack was a
real possibility.
Callum: Yeah, I'm old enough to remember those times – the times of the Cold War. It
was quite a scary time when you look back on it now.
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 2 of 5
Yvonne: Hmmm. The government got together with the BBC and wrote a secret script.
It was to be recorded and broadcast every two hours if there was a nuclear
attack.
Callum: Now that must have been a very difficult script to write.
Yvonne: Exactly, but that's what the BBC and the government had to do. And when it
was written, it was hidden away in the National Archives ready for use. But
recently, the script was 'declassified'. Callum, why don't you explain that for us?
Callum: Well if there's a document which is meant to be secret, then it's 'classified'. It's
given a classification like 'Top Secret' and only a few people can see it. But
when it becomes public - after thirty years in Britain, these documents can be
made public – we say it's been 'declassified'. So a 'declassified' document is a
document that used to be secret, you couldn't see it, but now, everyone can see
it.
Yvonne: Now before we find out what was in that nuclear script, let's look at some of
the language that we'll come across. Callum, people get confused by the word
'casualties'…
Callum: Well the word 'casualties' is a noun and it's to talk about not just the number of
people who are killed, but are also killed or injured in an accident or a war.
Yvonne: Thanks, Callum. Now as we listen to a reading of part of that declassified
nuclear script, try to find out what three things the script was asking people to
do…
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 3 of 5
FROM A REPORT BYMARK SANDERS
This is the Wartime Broadcasting Service. This country has been attacked with nuclear
weapons. Communications have been severely disrupted, and the number of casualties and the
extent of the damage are not yet known. Stay tuned to this wavelength, stay calm and stay in
your own homes.
Yvonne: Oooh, that makes me feel really cold.
Callum: It's definitely quite chilling to listen to that as though a nuclear attack has
already happened.
Yvonne: So what three things did the script ask everyone to do, Callum?
Callum: Well, it told people to 'stay tuned' which means, don't change your radio
channel, keep listening to this one for news and information. It told people to
'stay calm' – because of course, panicking in an emergency isn't useful. And
finally, the script asked everyone to stay at home – don't go outside.
Yvonne: Thanks, Callum.
Now the government and the BBC discussed what should go into the secret
script from 1972 to 1975!
Callum: …three years - that's a long time. It's a lot longer than we have to write a "6
Minute English" script!
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 4 of 5
Yvonne: It certainly is – that's for sure. But then, we don't have to write scripts that are
really that important, do we? I've another chilling extract for you from the
nuclear script which explains why people were being asked to stay at home…
FROM A REPORT BYMARK SANDERS
Remember, there is nothing to be gained by trying to get away. By leaving your homes you
could be exposing yourselves to greater danger.
Yvonne: So trying to 'get away' – to run away from home might have been even more
dangerous for people than staying inside their homes. Do you happen to know
why they said that Callum?
Callum: Well, there'd be a number of reasons. One, if there's a nuclear attack, then
there's a danger of radiation sickness in the air. You'd be a little safer staying at
home. But also, you know, there could be panic on the streets, the traffic would
be chaos, it would be very dangerous. So, best to stay at home – safest. That's
what they believed.
Yvonne: That sounds sensible. Anyway, here's something a little less frightening: the
declassified records show that one government official felt it was really, really
important for someone from the BBC, with a voice that most people knew
and trusted, should be the one to record the announcement. And this was
because the government didn't want people to believe that the BBC had been
'obliterated' – totally destroyed – gone forever!
Callum: Well that just shows how important the BBC was - and of course, still is today
for many people around the world!
Yvonne: Absolutely. Now Callum – today's big question was: When was the British
National Archives started? And your answer was…
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 5 of 5
Callum: Well I said 850 years ago - but it was just a guess.
Yvonne: Ahh – it was a good guess – you were 50 years out. It was 900 years ago.
Callum: 900 years ago. Oh dear, wrong again.
Yvonne: Never mind! Well, we hope you've enjoyed today's '6 Minute English'. And do

Yvonne: This is '6 Minute English' and I'm Yvonne Archer - and thanks to Callum for
joining me today. Hello Callum!
Callum: Hello Yvonne!
Yvonne: In today's programme we hear from a poet. But first – Callum, are you any
good at writing poetry?
Callum: Umm, not really – no – not at all!
Yvonne: Well don't worry about it because we've a special interview with someone who
is good at poetry. But first, a poetic question for Callum: Which is Britain's
favourite poem? Is it
a) "Oh My Luve's Like a Red, Red Rose" by Robert Burns
b) "How Do I love Thee?" by Elizabeth Barratt Browning – OR…
c) "Shall I Compare Thee to a Summer's Day?" by William Shakespeare
Callum: Well I remember this competition but I don't remember the answer. I'm going
to go for Shakespeare - "Shall I Compare Thee to a Summer's Day" because
he's probably our most well known writer.
Yvonne: That's a good choice but - we'll find out whether you're right or wrong at the
end of the programme.

Dave Neita is a barrister – a lawyer who speaks on behalf of people or
organisations in the higher courts of law. But Dave is also a poet, and in his
interview, he uses the words 'metaphors' and 'symbolism' – both very useful for
talking in English about poetry. Callum – what can you tell us about
'metaphors'?
Callum: Well 'a metaphor' is a way of describing something or someone by using the
qualities of something else. For example, in England we have very cold wind,
it's so cold, we describe it as 'a biting wind' – 'a biting wind'. So that's a
metaphor; it's not really biting, but we say 'a biting wind'.
Yvonne: Excellent. And what about 'symbolism'?
Callum: Well 'symbolism' is when we take an object, a shape or even an idea and we
use that to represent something else that we want to talk about.
Yvonne: Okay, great! So here's an example of 'symbolism' as used in one of Dave's
poems:
DAVE NEITA
Mind the Gap… mind the gap between the rich and the poor
If nothing is done, it will extend even more
Yvonne: 'Mind the gap' is an announcement and a sign that we often hear and see at
London Underground train stations. They warn passengers to be careful when
getting on and off trains and platforms because of the space between them. But
what does the announcement and sign symbolise in that poem Callum?
Callum: Well here, Dave has used 'mind the gap' – to symbolise the gap or the
difference in wealth between rich people and poor people. He's saying that
there's a gap between them and he's giving us a warning that if we're not
careful, that gap will get even wider.
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 3 of 4
Yvonne: So 'Mind the Gap' delivers a message from Dave about poverty.
DAVE NEITA
Mind the Gap… mind the gap between the rich and the poor
If nothing is done, it will extend even more
Yvonne: Now as we hear more from him, try to catch the three things he says poetry can
communicate – which three things can poetry tell us about?
DAVE NEITA
Poetry can communicate feelings, thoughts and ideas by way of metaphors and symbolism.
But poetry can also tell stories and that is the flexibility of poetry; it lends itself to everyone to
do with it as they choose.
Yvonne: Callum, which three things can poetry communicate?
Callum: Dave says that poetry can communicate feelings, thoughts and ideas.
Yvonne: Yes, and we also heard how poetry is flexible so it 'lends itself to' other things
such as sending a message, as in 'Mind the Gap' - or even telling a story.
Before Dave came to England from Jamaica in 1995, he decided to write a
letter to the Queen – except, his letter was really a poem which told his story!
"Letter to the Queen" uses the word 'hospitality' and the term 'short notice'.
Callum, what do we mean by them?
Callum: Well, if someone shows us 'hospitality', they make us feel welcome and
comfortable. And 'short notice' is if you don't tell people you're going to do
something until just a little bit of time before you do it. So for example, if you
ask me to come to the '6 Minute English' studio only two minutes before we're
due to record, you are giving me very 'short notice'.
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 4 of 4
Yvonne: As if I would! Okay, let's get an extract from Dave Neita's poem "Letter to the
Queen"…
DAVE NEITA
When your people come down to Jamaica
We treat them like royalty
So when I come up to England
I'm expecting the same hospitality
I don't have anywhere to stay
Because I'm coming up on short notice
So please, I'm asking you to fix me up a place inna Buckingham Palace
Yvonne: I wonder whether Dave actually sent the Queen his poem?
Callum: Oh well, I doubt it – because I'm sure he didn't stay at Buckingham Palace
when he arrived in England!
Yvonne: No – right. Now let's move on to the answer to today's big question. Which is
Britain's favourite poem Callum?
Callum: Well, I wasn't sure. I guessed that it was "Shall I Compare Thee to a Summer's
Day?" by William Shakespeare because he's probably our most famous writer.
Was I right – was I right?!
Yvonne: No you weren't – no you weren't! I guessed the same one at first – but anyway.
It was actually "How Do I Love Thee?" by Elizabeth Barratt Browning. But
that's all we've got time for today on '6 Minute English'. Do join us again for

Yvonne: Hello, this is '6 minute English' - I'm Yvonne Archer…
Callum: And I'm Callum Robertson.
Yvonne: Hi Callum - and thanks for joining me! In today's programme, we've got an
interesting case from Italy and it makes us think about the question of – well,
when as an adult, should you stop depending on your parents - financially?
Callum: Hmmm…
Yvonne: But let me ask you this: when did you stop depending on your parents?
Callum: Well I suppose, financially, it would be when I got my first job and gradually
became less financially dependent. So I suppose, when I was about 19 - 20
when I could make my own way.
Yvonne: Well we're going to hear more about that topic, obviously, but first, the big
question. Are you ready Callum?
Callum: Oh – yes, another one of your tricky questions.
Yvonne: Yes, but you usually get them right; let's see how you do. A 12 year old boy in
the United States was the first to divorce his parents – but when did that
happen? Was it in
a) 1992
b) 1998 – or
c) 2001?
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 2 of 4
Callum: Oh – now I remember this – I remember this, but, I can't remember when it
was. I'm going to plump for 1998.
Yvonne: Good choice, but as usual we'll have to wait until the end of the programme to
find out. Now today's report – we're going back to that question about adults
who are still financially dependent on their parents. As we listen to the report,
we'll come across the term 'expenses incurred'. Callum, can you explain that
for us please?
Callum: If you 'incur expenses' – you do something which costs money. So for example,
going to work usually incurs travel expenses – so that's the price of your bus
fare, your petrol or your train ticket.
Yvonne: And what about the words 'pursue' and 'aspirations'?
Callum: Well, if you 'pursue an aspiration' – you follow a dream to do something. So
for example, if you pursue an aspiration to be an English teacher – then you
work hard, you study and you train to become an English teacher.
Yvonne: Lovely. In today's report from the BBC's Emma Wallis, we hear about a court
case – a legal case. A man was taken to the highest court in Italy because he
didn't want to 'pay maintenance' – to give money to support his twenty year old
son, David. As we listen, try to find out who wins the court case; is it David or
his father?
EMMA WALLIS
The court ruled that David, who still lives with his mother, should carry on receiving threehundred
euros a month from his separated father, as well as half of any extra expenses he
incurred. The reason; Italian law believes that 'children' have the right, even as adults, to
pursue their dreams and aspirations.
Yvonne: Callum, who won the court case – was it David or his father?
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 3 of 4
Callum: Well it was David who won the court case. The court ruled – or the court
ordered his father to continue paying David money so that he can pursue his
dream.
Yvonne: And the ruling came from the highest court in Italy, so David's father will just
have to pay up! Now David is twenty years old. Is he too old to live with his
mum and get money from his dad as well? What do you think Callum?
Callum: I think it's difficult – different countries have different cultures. So, ummm –
the court has ruled and I don't have a better opinion than the court.
Yvonne: Now in the next part of Emma Wallis' report, we'll hear about David's dreams
and aspirations are. But first, a little help with the language we'll come across:
Callum, what does 'to quit a job' mean?
Callum: Oh, if you leave your job you 'quit' your job. You don't want to do it any more
– you quit.
Yvonne: And what about 'to set a precedent'?
Callum: Oh, that's a legal term – 'to set a precedent'. It's when a law is given for the first
time and from then on, in future cases, it can be referred to. They can say, well
this happened in this case, so we can use that same law in this case.
Yvonne: Okay – here's Emma Wallis again…
EMMA WALLIS
David's mother said that David had quit his job to enrol on a course, training to become a
hairdresser. Until he's able to maintain himself economically, David's father, according to the
court, which has set a precedent for all future cases, will have to keep David in the manner to
which he's become accustomed.
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 4 of 4
Yvonne: So David's left his job to learn how to become a hairdresser. And while he's
training, he wants money from his father so that he won't have to change the
way he's always lived. And the phrase we heard there was?
Callum: The money is needed 'to keep David in the manner to which he's become
accustomed' – to continue with the way of life he's now used to.
Yvonne: Right and so David's a lucky man really, isn't he? But do you think that we're
always children in the eyes of our parents?
Callum: Oh yes, absolutely. I don't think it matters. However old you are, you are still
your parents' child. Yes, absolutely.
Yvonne: Now Callum – today's big question was: a 12 year old boy in the United States
was the first to divorce his parents – but when did that happen? And you
said…
Callum: 1998?
Yvonne: Ah – you're right… no, you're wrong. It was 1992 -
Callum: Ah – that long ago?
Yvonne: It was. And it was a young boy who actually terminated his mother's rights to
him so she couldn't visit with him – she didn't have any legal rights over him
any more. And that was way back in 1992.
Callum: Oh, what a sad case.
Yvonne: Quite sad indeed. But that's all we've got time for today! Do join us again next

Yvonne: Hi, I'm Yvonne Archer, this is '6 minute English' and with me today is Callum
Robertson. Hello Callum!
Callum: Hello Yvonne!
Yvonne: Today, words of wisdom. Callum – are you wise enough to explain the word
'wisdom' for us?
Callum: Well, I'll give it go! I'd say that 'wisdom' is something that usually comes to us
as we gain more knowledge and experiences in life. And a wise person knows
and understands how to make sensible decisions based on that knowledge and
on those experiences even when the decisions are difficult.
Yvonne: Nice explanation.
Callum: Oh, well thank you!
Yvonne: So that's why older are usually the wisest because they've had more time to
gather knowledge and experiences in life – like Callum!
Callum: Are you saying I'm old?!
Yvonne: Didn't say anything! So wise words there from a wise man – Callum. But
before we hear more on today's topic, are you wise enough to get today's
question right, Callum?
Callum: Oh, I hope so!
6 minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 2 of 5
Yvonne: Good. Who said "Life is like an onion: you peel it off one layer at a time and
sometimes you weep." Was it:
a) Carl Sandburg
b) Alan Bennet – or
c) Confucius?
Callum: I don't know who Carl Sandburg is, Alan Bennet is a British writer, Confucius
is an old philosopher… I'm going to say Confucius - I don't know but I'll say
Confucius.
Yvonne: Nice choice - but we'll find out whether you're right or wrong later on.
Now in today's report about words of wisdom – words and sayings which can
help us understand how to be successful in life - we'll come across the word
'diplomacy', You've probably heard it before in news reports but let's get
Callum to tell us about it anyway.
Callum: Well, 'diplomacy' is – I suppose it's a skill really. It's an ability to say and do
things without offending or upsetting people. And in news reports, we
sometimes hear about 'diplomats' – and it's their job to work in international
relations, helping countries develop good relationships with each other.
Yvonne: But if someone says you're 'diplomatic' – it isn't always a compliment, is it?
Callum: Well no, not always. Some people might find it offensive if we don't tell them
exactly what we mean or how we feel because we’re trying to be kind – we're
trying to be diplomatic – we don't want to upset them. And that can leave some
people wondering what we really mean.
Yvonne: Thanks Callum. So now, the BBC's Vanessa Feltz recently did a show about
wisdom and the key to success – happiness in life. As she tells us what one
listener said, try to find out which three areas of life they're talking about...
6 minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 3 of 5
VANESSA FELTZ
Communication is the key to success but use diplomacy at home, at work - wherever you are.
There may well be people listening who think the very opposite is true: keep quiet – silence is
the key to success in romance and at work.
Yvonne: Callum, which three areas of life does Vanessa mention there?
Callum: Well she was talking about finding the key to success in life at home, life at
work and also in romance – in our love lives.
Yvonne: Oooh! So all areas of life really. But, is it better to keep quiet if there's an
argument or is it better to communicate in a diplomatic way – so, talk about
things without upsetting the other person?
Callum: Umm – well that's a difficult question because of course, it depends on the
situation, your relationship, the person you're talking to... For example, how
old are they, how well do you know them and how do they get angry? Very
quickly or not? All these things you have to think about.
Yvonne: Yes, it's a tricky question.
Now in the next part of Vanessa's programme on words of wisdom, she uses
some really lovely phrases. First, 'to keep schtum'. Callum?
Callum: 'To keep schtum' – well it's actually a mixture of English and Yiddish, which is
the Jewish language. But it's an expression that we use in everyday English as
well. 'To keep schtum' - it means to keep quiet and not say anything.
Yvonne: Lovely. We'll also hear the word 'fence' as in the term 'to sit on the fence' – and,
to 'not state your case either way'. Don't those terms have similar meanings,
Callum?
6 minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 4 of 5
Callum: Yes, they do. If you 'sit on the fence' and don't get off, or you 'don't state your
case', you don't tell people what you think and whether you agree with them or
not. And in an argument, it's not clear whose side you're on.
Yvonne: Okay – here's Vanessa again. She speaks a little more quickly this time - but
try to catch those phrases…
VANESSA FELTZ
If you just keep 'schtum' and ride out the bad situation, you don't say anything, you don't get
off the fence. In fact, you don't register at all. You're just, quiet, quiet, laid back and retiring, it
will all go away – or it will all improve on its own and you won't have had to state your case
either way. We're taking calls on wisdom this morning –'wisdom' you know that word -
'sagacity' – another lovely word for wisdom!
Yvonne: Wow, Vanessa really loves the English language, doesn’t she?! But I don't
think anyone has enough 'sagacity' – wisdom – to know all the answers in life.
Callum: Well, 'a sage' might – and that's another word for a wise man, 'a sage'.
Yvonne: And luckily, Callum – you're my sage.
Callum: Ahh.
Yvonne: So please, don't get today's big question wrong! Who said "Life is like an
onion: you peel it (off) one layer at a time and sometimes you weep"?
Callum: Well, I took a guess at Confucius.
Yvonne: And your guess was…wrong.
Callum: Oh no, not again!

Yvonne: Sorry, Callum. Yes, it was Carl Sandburg – an American poet.

Asteroid Mission
6 minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 1 of 5
Yvonne: Hello, I’m Yvonne Archer and this is 6 minute English. Today, we’re talking
about a rather exciting space mission and with me is Callum Robertson. Hello!
Callum: Hello Yvonne. Wow! Do you think there'll be space for an extra passenger –
for me - on that space mission?
Yvonne: Well, the spacecraft won't leave until about 2017 – so anything can happen by
then! But, before you start packing Callum, do you know anything about
asteroids, Callum? I mean, I found out that there are millions of them
travelling around our solar system.
Callum: Yeah... asteroids are - I suppose they're planets, I mean, big pieces of rock,
maybe a few miles or a few kilometres wide - and they move around the sun in
the same way that the earth moves around the sun.
Yvonne: Right, and in today's report we'll hear more about them. But we'll also come
across the term 'for analysis'. Can you explain that for us, Callum?
Callum: Sure. If something is given to you 'for analysis', you go through the process of
examining it - looking carefully at it to try to understand what it is or what it's
made of.
Yvonne: Now, before we hear that report, let's give you that big question Callum. I've
been scratching my head about this because you keep on getting them right!
But anyway - according to scientists, when was the last time that an asteroid
hit earth?
6 minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 2 of 5
Was it a) 85 million years ago
b) 65 million years ago or
c) 45 million years
Callum: Well ummm… I'm not really old enough to remember this…
Yvonne: Really???
Callum: No, and it's going to be a complete guess. So I'm just going to go for the
middle one; I'm going to go for 65 million years.
Yvonne: Okay, well we'll find out the answer to that question at the end of the
programme.
The space mission that's being worked on by European scientists and engineers
is called Marco Polo. As the BBC's Christine McGourty's tells us about it, try
to find the answer this two-part question: Where do the scientists hope to land
and what do they want to bring back to earth?
CHRISTINE MCGOURTY
The plan is to select a small asteroid - less than 1 kilometre across - and to send a spacecraft
there. It would land and drill beneath the surface to collect a mixture of dust and rubble to
bring back to Earth for analysis.
Yvonne: Callum, where do the scientists hope to land?
Callum: Well, they want to land on an asteroid but they haven't 'selected' – or chosen
which one yet.
Yvonne: That's right – and they want to select an asteroid that's less than one kilometre
wide – as the report said: less than one kilometre "across". And what do they
hope to bring back to earth from the asteroid?
6 minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 3 of 5
Callum: Well, rubbish really!
Yvonne: A load of old rubbish!
Callum: Well exactly! They said they'd like to bring back 'dust' and 'rubble' – so small,
tiny pieces of the asteroid which they'll take from under the surface. So they'll
dig down into the asteroid using a special drill, collect up some dust and
rubbish and bring that back.
Yvonne: Fantastic! And their analysis of the dust and rubble and rubbish should show
the scientists what asteroids are made of. Interesting, but will it be useful for us
to know about that here on earth? Hopefully, Christine has an answer for us in
the next part of her report…
CHRISTINE MCGOURTY
Asteroids are debris leftover from the formation of the solar system, around 4.6 billion years
ago. Studying their pristine material should provide new insights into the ingredients of the
early solar system and how planets like our own evolved.
Yvonne: So the Marco Polo space mission should help us understand more about what
our solar system was made up of – it's ingredients. And scientists also hope to
learn new information and get a better understanding about how planets like
earth gradually changed and developed – how they evolved.
So Callum - what about all those really scary stories about asteroids crashing
and colliding with earth and killing us – wiping us all out?
Callum: Well, there certainly have been some movies along that now. I think
"Armageddon" and "Deep Impact" were two movies where there were some –
some crazy schemes were developed to try and push the asteroids into a
6 minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 4 of 5
different path so they wouldn't hit the earth. But I don't know if that's really
possible.
Yvonne: Well, let's hope that if it is possible, in real life, they will find a way how to
stop asteroids hitting us here on earth by March the 16th 2880.
Callum: March the 16th 2880?
Yvonne: Yep.
Callum: It's a very specific date, Yvonne! Do you know something?
Yvonne: Yes. Scientists believe that's when an asteroid of about 10 kilometres – which
is about seven miles wide – will actually hit earth.
Callum: Really? Wow!
Yvonne: Yeah. But we won't be here anyway, will we?
Callum: Well, I hope not!
6 minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 5 of 5
Yvonne: But we must look after our planet for future generations, mustn't we?
Callum: Oh, of course.
Yvonne: Okay – now to that question: When was the last time that an asteroid hit earth?
a) 85 million years ago
b) 65 million years ago or
c) 45 million years
Callum: Well, I made a complete guess at 65 million years ago.
Yvonne: And once again, you were right Callum!
Callum: Really?
Yvonne: Yes.
Callum: Oh yes! Congratulations to me!
Yvonne: …Because that's when the dinosaurs were all wiped out - by an asteroid it's
thought.
Callum: Ahh – okay.
Yvonne: But that's all we've got time for in today's programme. Do join us again next
time for more '6 minute English'.

Callum: I'm Callum Robertson. Hello!
Yvonne: Hello Callum! In this week's programme, English words that are often
'mispronounced'. Callum – can you explain 'mispronounced' for us?
Callum: Certainly. If you MIS-PRO-NONCE… if you 'mispronounce' a word, you
don't say it correctly. You get some of the sounds wrong in that word.
Yvonne: Very good. And is there a word that you often mispronounce, Callum?

Yvonne: I didn't think so - so I've got three difficult ones here for you! But, before you
read them out, any thoughts?
Callum: Well, looking at these words on paper, I think there's a good chance that some
people would mispronounce them. Yeah.
Yvonne: And that's why you're saying them instead of me! So, off you go…
Callum: Okay, the words are: regularly…ethnicity…and anaesthetist. Whew!
Yvonne: Yeah, but you said them slowly, Callum. Yeah, that was tough. But there are
three thousand other Brits who also agree that those words are difficult to say.

Page 2 of 4
They were recently questioned by a company called Spinvox and the research
showed that 'regularly', 'ethnicity' and 'anaesthetist' – ooh, I said it - are some
of the most mispronounced words in the English language. Now before we
hear more about that research, I've a question for you, Callum: How many
sounds do experts say we need to be able to pronounce - so that we can speak
English clearly? Is it:
a) 44
b) 104 - or 400?
Callum: Well, I'm fairly confident on this as I've just made a series on pronunciation. In
British English, there's generally about forty-four sounds that are needed to
pronounce English words. So, about forty-four – there's maybe a few more -
but forty-four; that's my answer.
Yvonne: Well, I'm not telling you! You'll have to wait until the end of the programme.
Now as we hear an extract from the BBC's Today programme on the most
mispronounced words in English, try to foind – whew – I can't pronounce
'try…' - try to find out which word was the most mispronounced…
THE TODAY PROGRAMME
If you find 'statistics' and 'ethnicity' difficult to pronounce, it appears you're not alone. The
Daily Mail says they're among the top ten most troublesome words in the English language.
Researchers who questioned three thousand people found that the most mispronounced word
was 'phenomenon' followed by 'anaesthetist' (anaesthetist) and 'remuneration'.
Yvonne: Callum, which word was the most troublesome – the most difficult to
pronounce?
Callum: Well, that was 'phenomenon'… phenomenon.
6 minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 3 of 4
Yvonne: Phenomenon… phenomenon… Yep, I have to say that I have to take that one
really slowly - and just looking at it on paper makes me nervous. So why do
you think so many of us get it wrong, Callum?
Callum: Well of course, when we get nervous, we generally make more mistakes. But
here, it's the mixture of the particular sounds that are in words – that's what
causes the problems. So having the 'm' and 'n' sounds – the 'mmm' and 'nnnn' in
'phenomenon' – having so many of them so close together – that makes it a
difficult word to pronounce.
Yvonne: Hmmm - and what about 'anaesthetist'?
Callum: Well 'anaesthetist' - it contains an odd mixture of 't' and 'th' sounds – there's
also an 's' in there as well before that group of consonants and that also makes
things difficult to pronounce.
Yvonne: Oh dear, it certainly is!
Now the newspaper that published those research results describes such words
as 'tongue twisters'. But I wouldn't call them tongue-twisters really, would you
Callum?
Callum: Umm - not really, no - because 'tongue twisters' are generally a sentence or an
expression that is very difficult to say quickly and repeat again and again and
again.
Yvonne: Well, I'm feeling really mean today, Callum. Go on - give us an example - and
don't - say – it - slowly!
Callum Okay – try this one and a very famous one is: "Peter Piper picked a peck of
pickled pepper".
6 minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 4 of 4
Yvonne: …Cor – that was pretty good, wasn't it?! Of course, but we don't have to say
tongue twisters in life – but we usually do have to use words like umm, what –
ummm - 'statistics' or 'February'. I can't even say it myself – 'February'.
Callum: February.
Yvonne: February.
Callum: Well yes. It is difficult to get through life without saying words like 'February'.
Yes.
Yvonne: But the research shows that many of us try to do just that. We don't want to
feel embarrassed when we mispronounce those words so we just avoid them.
And that's a really bad example for learners, isn't it?
Callum: Well, I don't know about that. It's something natural that native speakers do.
That…you know, if you're not sure how to pronounce a word, choose another
word…or… And I do the same in writing in spelling; if there's a word I'm not
sure how to spell, my spelling isn't, you know, perfect - sometimes I will rewrite
to avoid using that word. So, as in anything, pronunciation does only get
better with practise so don't worry about it!
Yvonne: Just go for it. Okay, now for the answer to our question: How many sounds do
experts say we need to be able to pronounce - so that we can speak English
clearly? Is it: a) 44, b) 104 or c) 400?
Callum: Well, as I said, forty-four; I'm fairly confident that it's forty-four or thereabouts.
Yvonne: Ah, you knew it all the time, Callum. Well, that's all we've got time for today.

Big hills and small mountains
6 minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 1 of 4
Yvonne: Hello, I’m Yvonne Archer - this is '6 minute English' - and today, Callum's
with me. Hi Callum…
Callum: Hi Yvonne
Yvonne: Now this week, we ask: is there any difference between a really big hill and a
small mountain? Dictionaries basically say that a hill is not as high as a
mountain - and a mountain is higher than a hill! Anything to add, Callum?
Callum: Well, if big hills and small mountains were the same, we probably wouldn't
need separate nouns for them in English for them, would we?
Yvonne: Good point. But before we find out more, here's a question for you: Which of
these three places is proud to have the world's highest hill? Is it:
a) Beverley Hills
b) Dar Es Salaam or
c) Oklahoma
Callum: Ummm - this is just going to be a guess because I really have no idea. I'm
going to guess at Oklahoma.
Yvonne: Okay, we'll find out the answer at the end of the programme!
Recently, a report from the BBC's David Bamford had some people thinking
that in Snowdonia, North Wales, people were making a mountain out of a
molehill! But before we hear about that story, here's a look at some of the
language we'll come across. Callum, what can you tell us about 'Ordnance
Survey maps'?
6 minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 2 of 4
Callum: Well, 'Ordnance Survey' is the name for Great Britain's official mapping
agency. So their maps are known as the most accurate, the most up-to-date and
most reliable maps available –even the government relies on them. And even –
and I do too. When I go walking, I always take an Ordance Survey map with
me and my compass.
Yvonne: Excellent! So we'll hear 'Ordnance Survey maps' in today's report - but listen
out for the answer to this question as well: How high is a mountain?
For many years now, Wales has been very popular with both tourists and
mountaineers – people who enjoy climbing mountains. So, how would you feel
if what you proudly think of as your local mountain is officially classified as -
a mere hill?
DAVID BAMFORD
That's been the case 'til now for Mynydd Graig Goch, in North Wales. The locals KNEW it
was a mountain - that's why they called it Mynydd - the Welsh word for 'mountain'. But
British Ordnance Survey maps classified it as a hill because it was assumed to be under two
thousand feet high - that's six hundred and nine metres - the recognized minimum height for a
mountain.
Yvonne: So how high is a mountain? Callum?
Callum Well anything over two thousand feet high – now that's six hundred and nine
metres high – that's a mountain.
Yvonne: And anything under - or less than - two thousand feet high is officially - a hill.
So what happened - with our mountain in Wales – what happened there?
6 minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 3 of 4
Callum: The report said that Ordnance Survey assumed it was less than two thousand
feet high - but they didn't actually know for sure that that was true.
Yvonne: Ooh - a big mistake, eh?! But luckily, a group of mountaineers who live in the
area used very reliable equipment to measure their mountain and they proved
that it's definitely not a hill. It's six inches high – or fifteen point two
centimetres higher than the minimum - so Ordnance Survey will change their
map.
Callum: Hurray for Wales, they've finally got their extra mountain!
Yvonne: Yeah…
Callum – you're a film buff… do you know anything about a film with a
similar story?
Callum: Well yes, there was a romantic comedy with the actor Hugh Grant in 1995.
And that was called "The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill, But Came Down a
Mountain".
Yvonne: I love that title! Now as we hear what the film is about, try to guess what 'a
cartographer' is – what's 'a cartographer'?
DAVID BAMFORD
In the film, a Welsh community fought the attempts of two English cartographers to
downgrade their local mountain to a hill. And they did so by carrying mounds of earth up to
the summit when the cartographers weren't looking.
Yvonne: Oooh - that was very naughty! Callum, what did the community do to make
sure that their mountain wouldn't become a hill – making it less important?
6 minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 4 of 4
Callum: Well, what they did was they took 'mounds of earth' – which is piles of soil -
up to the summit – and that's the highest point on a mountain or hill, that's the
summit. And so they did that to make sure that it was high enough to be a
mountain when the officials measured it.
Yvonne: Crafty - and what's 'a cartographer', Callum?
Callum: Well, a cartographer is an official whose job it is to draw maps.
Yvonne: Great. Now onto today's big question: Which of these three places is proud to
have the world's highest hill? Is it:
a) Beverley Hills
b) Dar Es Salaam - or
c) Oklahoma
Callum, what was your answer?
Callum: Well, my answer was just – purely just a guess. I guessed at Oklahoma because
Beverley Hills, well that's a very rich suburb of Los Angeles and I don't think
there are any really big hills there. Dar Es Salaam – I don't know anything
about Dar Es Salaam – I've never been there. But I've never been to Oklahoma
but I can remember from movies and so on, that it's – quite a few mountains
and hills there. So it's purely a guess but I'm going to go for Oklahoma.
Yvonne: Excellent guess and well worked out actually, because you're absolutely right!
Callum: Whoo! Excellent – oh yes!
Yvonne: So well done to you Callum. And that's all for today's '6 minute English'.

Jackie: Hello, this is 6 minute English with bbclearningenglish.com. I'm Jackie Dalton,
speaking to you from the streets of Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital. With me
today is our producer in Bangladesh, Senjuti Masud. Hello Senjuti!
Senjuti: Hello!
Jackie: There's a reason why we're out in the streets today, if you listen to the sounds
going on around us, you'll get a clue as to what today's programme is about.
Senjuti, today's topic was your idea… can you tell us what it is?
Senjuti: Yes, traffic.
Jackie: Right, and when I asked you… 'Let's make a programme about Dhaka - what
shall we make it about?' Why was traffic the first thing that came to your mind?
(both discuss)
Jackie: Because there is so much traffic out here and it's so noisy, why don't we go
inside so we can hear each other speak!
Ah, that's better. Before we continue, I have a question for you: many cities in
the world have introduced a 'congestion charge', which is when you have to
pay to drive your car into the city center. But which of these cities does NOT
have a congestion charge?
Stockholm
Singapore
6 minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 2 of 4
Geneva
Senjuti: I think it's Singapore
Jackie: Well, we'll find out if you were correct at the end of the programme. But now,
let's look at some traffic related vocabulary. I like to use bad traffic as an
excuse when I come in late to the office in the mornings. So I might say
something like 'Ah, I'm sorry, I was stuck in traffic!'
Senjuti: Yes, and an expression we often hear related to traffic is a 'traffic jam'. So
you could say, 'There was a really bad traffic jam!'
Jackie: Yes, a traffic jam. There are lots of traffic jams in Dhaka. You could also say
there's 'really heavy traffic' in Dhaka – heavy traffic – lots of vehicles on the
road. What other words come to mind when you think about traffic?
Senjuti: One word we might hear is chaos – when everything is crazy!
Jackie: Ah yes, chaos, everything is crazy and disorganized… it's chaos on the roads at
the moment! I think it takes me about half an hour to get to work in the
mornings.
Senjuti: Yes, it can quite boring…and that made me wonder: in Dhaka we spend so
much time sitting in traffic jams – what do people do so they don't get bored?
Jackie: OK, let's have a listen. As you listen try to answer this question: what kinds of
things do people do so they don't get bored in traffic?
Clip
Girl 1: I might play with my cell phone, maybe games or rechecking my inbox or may
be calling someone and chatting with them… with friends
6 minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 3 of 4
Man 1: We just wait for the traffic to get clear… and… listen to some CDs that we
have in our car.
Jackie: OK, so what did we have there?
Senjuti: Well, the girl says she plays with her cell phone. For example, she might play
games. And sometimes she chats to friends on the phone.
Jackie: And the man says he just waits for the traffic to clear and maybe listens to CDs
or something.
Senjuti: But one girl we spoke to just gets cross. Who does she get cross with? Listen
to find out.
Clip
Girl 2: Well actually when I am stuck in the traffic, I don't really think of anything,
just that I get mad…. I keep on thinking that… government …they are not
actually taking much care to, you know, solve this problem. And that's why the
traffic is increasing every single day.
Jackie: She gets cross with the government because she thinks the government isn't
doing enough to sort out the traffic. Senjuti, she used the word 'mad' there,
which is American English for angry – to get mad. What other emotion words
might we associate with being stuck in traffic?
Senjuti: frustration
Jackie: Frustration, to be frustrated. To be annoyed, usually because you can't achieve
something you that you want to achieve. Or things aren't going to plan.
Senjuti: I find being in traffic tedious.
Jackie: Tedious – another good word – very boring – tedious. So Senjuti what do you
do in traffic jams to try to make them a bit less tedious?
(both discuss)

Day-trip with a difference
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 1 of 4
Callum: Hello, I’m Callum Robertson, welcome to Six Minute English. With me today
is Neil Edgeller. Hello Neil.
Neil: Hi Callum.
Callum: Now in today’s programme we’re going to be looking at day-trips, but not your
average kind of day-trip. First Neil, can you explain what we mean by a daytrip.
Neil: Sure, a day-trip is like a short holiday. You go somewhere and come back on
the same day.
Callum: Yes, when I was a child I remember we used to go on day-trips to the beach or
day-trips to the forest. What about you Neil, did you or do you go on day-trips?
Neil: When I was a kid I lived in Canada and we often had visitors and we took them
to local places of interest on day-trips, for example Niagra Falls.
Callum: Wow, that’s a great place for a day trip. Our topic today is all about a day-trip
that is literally out of this world. The day-trips I’m talking about are into space.
If you’ve ever dreamt of being an astronaut, now you can make that dream
come true. Provided you can afford it!
Before we hear more about this, let’s have this week’s question. Now we’re
talking about space, so it’s a space related question for you Neil, which planet
is generally, is mostly the closest to Earth, is it:
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 2 of 4
a: Mars, b: Venus or c: Jupiter
Neil: Er, it’s Mars isn’t it?
Callum: OK, Well we’ll find out if you’re right at the end of the programme.
Now a company is selling tickets for day-trips to space. They’re building
special craft to do this and one of these was revealed to the public earlier this
year. We’re going to listen to BBC reporter Rajesh Mirchandani with some
more details but before we do here’s some of the vocabulary you’ll hear. First
‘glimpse’, ‘glimpse’, tell us about this word Neil.
Neil: ‘Glimpse’ is a word which means to see something, but to see it only for a
short time or not completely. It can be a verb, or a noun. You can ‘glimpse
something’ or you can ‘catch a glimpse of something’.
Callum: And one more expression to look out for, ‘under-wraps’, ‘under-wraps’, Neil?
Neil: If something is ‘under-wraps’ it means it is secret, it has not been shown to the
public.
Callum: Okay, so you’ll hear those two expressions in this report. Also, listen out for
the answer to this question. How high above earth will the actual spaceship
travel?
RAJESH MIRCHANDANI
After four years secret development in California’s Mojave Desert, now the first public
glimpse of White Knight 2, the hardware designed to take paying passengers into space.
But this isn’t the spaceship, that’s still unfinished and under wraps. This is the launch aircraft
that will carry the spaceship to 50,000 feet from where it fires its own rockets and climbs to
62 miles above the Earth.
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 3 of 4
Callum: So Neil, let’s answer the distance question first. How high above the Earth will
the actual spaceship travel?
Neil: It’ll be 62 miles. Which is about 100 km.
Callum: So actually, for a day, trip, it’s not really that far, is it? Now there was also
mention of another distance, 50,000 feet, what was that?
Neil: Well there are two parts to the spacecraft. There is an aircraft, which is what
was revealed, and this plane is used to carry the actual spaceship. So the plane
carries the spaceship to 50,000 feet, which is about 15km, and then the
spaceship launches from there and goes up to 62 miles.
Callum: And what do we know about the spaceship itself?
Neil: Well not that much as that is what is still ‘under-wraps’, that’s still secret.
Callum: Ok, now Neil, would you fancy this day-trip? Would you fancy going up into
space?
Neil: One question, an important one. How much does it cost?
Callum: Well you can book a ticket for this space trip, this day-trip to space, for only
$200,000!
Neil: Well, er, no, that is my answer!
Callum: I think it would depend on what you get for your money. What do you get for
$200,000. Let’s have a listen to Rajesh Mirchandani who can tell us a bit about
that.
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 4 of 4
RAJESH MIRCHANDANI
The two-and-a-half hour sub-orbital trip offers five minutes of weightlessness and stunning
views before gliding back down.
Callum: So the whole trip takes two and a half hours and that includes 5 minutes of
weightlessness and stunning views.
‘Weightlessness’, can you explain that Neil.
Neil: It’s when you are floating in the air. If you’ve seen films of astronauts in
spaceships they just float around of course because there is no gravity. They
are weightless. So that’s one experience you’d have on the trip, weightlessness.
Callum: And stunning views. That was something else that was mentioned, stunning
views, meaning fantastic. Personally I think that would be an amazing thing to
see, to see the Earth from a great distance. I think if I had that money to spare,
I’d take the trip. Neil, would you?
Neil: No. I don’t like flying anyway!
Callum: OK, so that would be, probably you could look at it on television, so there you
go. Well that’s about all we have today, before we go though, the answer to
this week’s question. Which planet is mostly closest to Earth? Neil, you
said …..
Neil: I said Mars.
Callum: It’s actually Venus. Venus is actually closest to Earth for most, for most time.
So hard luck on that one.

Callum: Hello I’m Callum Robertson and with me today for 6 Minute English is Jackie
Dalton – hello Jackie.
Jackie: Hello Callum.
Callum: Now in the programme today we’re going to be talking about mysterious and
mythical creatures and dipping our toes into the cold water of crytptozoology.
Jackie: Cryptozoology? Well that’s a new word to me!
Callum: And to me Jackie! Cryptozoology is the study of animals that don’t fit into any
normal categories – so for example looking for living examples of animals
which are thought to be extinct
Jackie: So basically dinosaurs living in modern times?
Callum: Yes, yes And also the study of creatures for which there is no solid evidence
but which exist in legends and folklore.
Jackie: Like the Loch Ness Monster?
Callum: Exactly. And we’ll talk a little more about the Loch Ness monster later but first,
a question for you Jackie. A few weeks ago you asked me a question about an
English word which was based on a Latin verb. Well today I have a Greek
challenge for you. The prefix ‘crypto’ in cryptozoology originally comes
from Greek, but what does it mean? Does crypto mean:
a: unknown
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 2 of 4
b: hidden, or
c: mysterious
Jackie: Oh, I don’t know. I’m going to take a guess at ‘unknown’.
Callum: OK we’ll find out at the end of the programme if you are right. Now if I say to
you the Abominable Snowman – what does that mean to you?
Jackie: Er, to me that means a large scary monster that might come from the mountains
or something like that.
Callum: Exactly, now that’s one word for a creature that is believed to exist in many
parts of the world. In North America it’s known as Bigfoot or Sasquatch, we
know it as the Abominable Snowman and in Tibet and some other countries
it’s the Yeti. Now in each case the descriptions of this creature are quite similar.
In a recent edition of the BBC series From Our Own Correspondent journalist
Alastair Lawson reported on his meeting with a man in (meg Ha lair) northeast
India who had spent 10 years looking for their Yeti. Let’s have a listen to the
description from Alastair.
Alastair Lawson
Let me start with the Yeti. It's reputed to be an ape-like animal which stands and weighs
nearly two times more than the average man. An artist's impression of the animal - drawn
from descriptions provided by eye witnesses - also shows it to be surprisingly hairy. Its twotone,
thick black and grey coat seems incongruous in a part of India where the humidity is so
intense that an afternoon's walk often results in a soaking wet shirt.
Callum: He describes there an animal, about twice the size of a man which is very hairy.
But some of the language he uses suggests that he is not sure that the creature
exists. Jackie, Alastair says that the Yeti is ‘reputed to be’ an ape-like animal.
What does he mean by reputed-to be?
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 3 of 4
Jackie: This means something is believed to be true or said to be true but there isn’t
actually any proof that it is.
Callum: Yes, and he describes the animal as being ‘surprisingly’ hairy. Being hairy is a
typical feature of many of these creatures, so why is it surprising?
Jackie: Well it’s ‘surprisingly’ hairy because this particular Yeti is believed to inhabit
jungles which are hot and humid – so as he also says the thick coat seems
incongruous, incongruous – or to put it another way, out of place – it doesn’t
seem quite right that a creature living in that particular area would have such a
thick coat.
Callum: So he uses the phrase ‘reputed to be’, he describes the Yeti as ‘surprisingly
hairy’ and comments that this feature seems ‘incongruous’. Let’s listen again.
So what do you think of all this Jackie – do you think there are wild, unknown
ape-like creatures wondering around forests and mountains?
Jackie: Well I’d like to think that ‘cos it makes it seem rather exciting, but I don’t
think in these parts there are many signs of that.
Callum: No I mean, certainly in Great Britain we don’t have a Yeti, but we do have a
creature that is ‘studied’ by cryptozoologists, and that is, of course, Nessie!
Jackie: Ah yes, the Loch Ness monster.
Callum: Now Loch Ness is a very large lake in Scotland and there is reputed to be some
kind of large creature living in it. Perhaps a dinosaur-like water creature. There
have been some photos and some films which claim to show Nessie, but there’s
still no clear evidence.
Jackie: So have you ever seen it Callum?
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 4 of 4
Callum: I have been to Loch Ness a few times but the only monster I’ve seen is my own
reflection when looking at the water!
Jackie: Yes, I can see how you might think that. But do you think there is something
there? Do you believe in the Loch Ness Monster.
Callum: I’d like to say yes, but my head says no. I think it’s great for tourism and the
souvenir industry but I’m not convinced really by any of the evidence I’ve seen.
Well Jackie, it’s the time now to find out if you were right or wrong. What
does ‘crypto’ in the word ‘cryptozoology’ mean, from the original Greek. And
you said it meant:
Jackie: ‘Unknown’
Callum: And the answer is, it means ‘hidden’. So hard luck a good guess – but better
luck next time.
That’s all from this edition of 6 Minute English – bye for now. Goodbye

Callum: Hello I’m Callum Robertson and with me today for 6 Minute English is Jackie
Dalton – hello Jackie.
Jackie: Hello Callum.
Callum: Now Jackie, I’m going to play you something and I wonder if you can guess
what is being talked about. This is Ian Macwhirter, who’s a political
commentator:
Ian Macwhirter
The thing is that this is a bubble, and all bubbles eventually burst, and when they burst a lot of
people get hurt.
Jackie: Well you gave me a clue when you said that he’s a political commentator – so
it’s something to do with politics…
Callum: Well yes and no, really – not exactly politics, but certainly politics are involved.
Jackie: Can I listen again?
Callum: Of course. Here’s Ian Macwhirter again
Ian Macwhirter
The thing is that this is a bubble, and all bubbles eventually burst, and when they burst a lot of
people get hurt.
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 2 of 4
Jackie: Well I guess it’s to do with the economy and the one thing that comes to mind
at the moment is the housing market.
Callum: Exactly right well done. He was talking about the state of the housing market
in Britain. Can you explain what he means when he says ‘it’s a bubble and it’s
going to burst’?
Jackie: The price of property in Britain has been growing very quickly for over a
decade now. Prices have risen far far higher than salaries. So this increase in
prices happened in a strong economic period, but now things are not so good in
the economy and the prediction is that prices will fall again very quickly.
Callum: Exactly, I’m going to try and demonstrate this now. I have a balloon here, and
as I start blowing it gets bigger, and bigger, and bigger but it can’t go on
getting bigger for ever, at some point it becomes too big and it bursts. So that’s
what’s happened to the housing market in Britain. Prices have got so high, they
couldn’t get any higher and the bubble has burst – prices are coming down.
Jackie: You would think that would be good news because it means that houses would
become cheaper, more affordable.
Callum: It’s good if you want to buy, but for those who want to sell it means their house
might not be worth as much as they paid for it – this can lead to a lot of
financial difficulty – the hurt that Ian Macwhirter referred to. This situation is
known as ‘negative equity’, ‘negative equity’. Effectively this means your
property is worth less than you paid for it. Ian Macwhirter had a warning about
this – but who was his warning for, listen and find out.
Ian Macwhirter
I think particularly first time buyers really need to be warned that if you buy anywhere now
you'll be in negative equity within about a year, eighteen months.
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 3 of 4
Callum: So Jackie, who needs to be careful.
Jackie: Well he talked there about ‘first-time buyers’. ‘First-time buyers’. A first-time
buyer is someone who hasn’t owned a property before and so therefore is
buying a house for the first time.
Callum: That’s right, lets’ listen to Ian Macwhirter again
Ian Macwhirter
I think particularly first time buyers really need to be warned that if you buy anywhere now
you'll be in negative equity within about a year, eighteen months.
Callum: So Jackie, talking about this issue, what about you? Do you own a house or do
you rent?
Jackie: I rent, I would love to be able to own a house but as we know in London it’s
very very very expensive and it’s actually hard to buy your first house.
Callum: It is, it’s very hard and it’s very difficult to get that first ‘rung’ on the ‘property
ladder’. Now the ‘property ladder’ is what everybody talks about. What does
that mean?
Jackie: It’s kind of the idea that once you’ve bought your first house, after that, if you
want to move again, you’re going to need extra money to buy a nicer house. So
once you’ve bought your first one you can sell that, take the money from it and
move up into a bigger or nicer house which costs more money.
Callum: Yep, so it’s like a ladder, you keep going up and up and up. But it’s very
difficult to get that first step on to the property ladder.
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 4 of 4
Now one thing that people are talking a lot about this moment, it’s like a new
expression that’s come into the language, and it’s the ‘credit crunch’. Have you
heard this expression Jackie?
Jackie: Yes, it’s been on the news all the time, hasn’t it?
Callum: Absolutely, you can’t listen to a programme, you can’t turn over a newspaper
without seeing the expression ‘credit crunch’. What does it mean though?
Jackie: Well a ‘credit crunch’ is a period when it’s very difficult to get credit and the
interest rates are very high because the banks are scared of losing money. So
it’s not really a new phenomenon but the term is very new in everyday
vocabulary.
Callum: I did a search of the BBC website and Jackie, when do you think the first use of
this term I came across was? Was it in January 2007, June 2007 or December
2007?
Jackie: I think I can make a good guess at this one. I think it was June 2007 because
that’s when this all started up again and it became big in the news.
Callum: Exactly, well done. The answer is indeed June 2007. Now that won’t be the
first time that term was ever used, but it was the first reference to it that I could
find on the BBC website! Maybe you can find an earlier one. It did exist as a
term known and used by economists but now everyone knows it. It’s like a new
expression that’s been born in our lifetime! And as you said it does seem to be
in the headlines everyday.
Well that’s all the time we have time for this programme, but do join us again
for another 6 Minute English soon. Goodbye

The cost of living
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 1 of 4
Callum: Hello I’m Callum Robertson and with me today for 6 Minute English is Jackie
Dalton – hello Jackie.
Jackie: Hello Callum.
Callum: Today we’re going to be looking at the topic of the cost of living. What do we
mean by that expression, the cost of living?
Jackie: We use it to talk about our everyday expenditure, so what it costs us to live our
day to day lives, the cost of food, accommodation, fuel and so on.
Callum: Do you have any idea what you spend on these things do you know how much
it costs to live Jackie Dalton’s life?
Jackie: I have no idea whatsoever actually! I just shut my eyes and hand over my
credit card and hope for the best. How about you Callum?
Callum: Well yes, I figure out my monthly expenses and when I get paid I put that
money into a bank account and that’s only used for those regular bills. Any
money I have left over goes towards savings or the occasional luxury.
Jackie: Well that sounds very organised, Callum!
Callum: I suppose it is really. But if I didn’t budget like that I think I’d end up spending
all my money each month. Now you’ll notice I used the verb to budget there –
could you tell us a bit more about this word Jackie?
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 2 of 4
Jackie: Yes, ‘to budget’ means to plan your finances in the way you described, so that
you know you can afford the necessities. There is also a noun, ‘a budget’, you
can talk about your weekly or monthly budget, which is the amount of money
you set aside to spend on particular things.
Callum: So, for example, I have a monthly food budget. How about you Jackie? Now
we’re talking about this today because there was a recent report which set out
how much, in terms of money, was the minimum that someone needed to earn
each year to have an acceptable standard of living.
And that’s my question for you today Jackie. According to this report, which
we’ll hear more of in a minute, how much do you think was suggested as being
the minimum amount a single man needs for an acceptable standard of life in
Great Britain?
a) £11,200 (about US$22,400)
b) £13,400 (about US$26,800), or
c) £15,600 (about US$31,200)
Jackie: Well I think life in the UK has got quite expensive so I’m going to go for the
highest figure, £15,600.
Callum: OK, we’ll see if you’re right at the end of the programme.
This research was carried out by an organisation called the Joseph Roundtree
Foundation. Here’s their policy advisor, Donald Hirsch describing the project.
Donald Hirsch
This was very detailed research in which a number of groups of ordinary people had long
discussions about what really needs to go into a household budget to achieve a minimum
acceptable standard of living and they thought long and hard about what things are sort of
luxuries, what things we might want and what things people really would need to have and
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 3 of 4
this includes not just basics like food and shelter but also things which allow people to
participate in society.
Callum: So they wanted to find out not how much was the absolute minimum you could
live on, but how much you needed to be able to afford to live and also be
involved in a social life.
Jackie: They examined a wide range of possible expenditures in everyday life and
decided whether each item or service was essential or a luxury.
Callum: It was done by groups of ordinary people who thought “long and hard” about
household budgets. Jackie, to think long and hard about something…
Jackie: Yes, this is a good expression and it’s fairly simple to understand, to think long
and hard about something means to think very carefully about it. What’s
important to remember with this phrase is that it is a fixed expression, so you
think long and hard about something. You can’t say ‘to think hard and long’
about something, that sounds funny.
Callum: Now we’ve just got time to have a look at some of the items they discussed,
these groups, about whether they were essential or not essential for everyday
life. How about, what do you think they though about mobile phones?
Jackie: I would like to think they’re not essential for everyday life.
Callum: Could you live without yours?
Jackie: No!
Callum: Yes, it was, mobiles phones were regarded as being something that was
essential for everyday life. Television and a DVD player?
6 Minute English © bbclearningenglish.com 2008
Page 4 of 4
Jackie: I would say ‘yes’ if you want to in tune with what’s going on in your culture.
They are useful to have.
Callum: Absolutely, yes, that was a thought, that everybody, you know, needed to have
a television and a DVD player these days. Access to the internet?
Jackie: Yes, I would say so, that’s as important as having a television.
Callum: Well they said no, this survey, they said no at home, because people can still
access the internet if they want to an internet café or at a library for free, in
many cases. And what about a holiday, having a holiday?
Jackie: Oh, they’re essential, but it’s probably a luxury isn’t it.
Callum: Well it was regarded as being essential, one week budget holiday in the United
Kingdom each year was something that was regarded as being essential.
Well that is just about all the time we have for today. Before we go, the answer
to the question. How much money is needed to pay for all these essential things
and it was £13,400
c: 15,600
Now you said £15,600 Jackie, not as much as that, so but unfortunately you go
the answer wrong – again! Well never mind about that. Join us again for more

about stress. Stress at work. And I’m here with the very relaxed Jackie Dalton.
Jackie: Hi Doug, yes our topic today is about difficult jobs – they can make you feel
really stressed.
Doug: And Jackie as usual I have a question for you.
Jackie: Okay, well now I am feeling stressed! What’s the question?
Doug: Okay, here we go. Which of these three jobs is considered the most stressful?
Is it
a) a broadcaster
b) a teacher
c) a pilot
Which of those three jobs is considered the most stressful?
Jackie: Oh that’s a very tricky one. I won’t say broadcaster because I’m usually not
very stressed.
Teacher….I think can be extremely stressful because you’ve got lots of people
with you all the time who you’ve got to control.
Pilot is probably quite scary because you got to…. you are responsible for lots
of lives but I’m going to go with teacher because
I think day to day it’s quite a stressful job.

Woman: I work as a waitress at a hotel.
Val: So that’s a stressful job?
Woman: Well, it can be.
Val: What’s stressful about it?
Woman: Well, just getting everything done on time and getting all the customers fed at
the same time and it’s really busy and things like that.
Doug: Well, she’s a waitress. She works in a restaurant in a hotel and she says her job
can be stressful sometimes.
Jackie: Well if it’s a busy restaurant and there’s a lot to do that can be really stressful.
And I’m sure some customers can be difficult, you know when they complain
about the service or the food.
Doug: And there’s a lot to do. Getting everything done – that’s stressful.
You’re listening to BBC LearningEnglish.com.

Stressed. To be stressed. Are you stressed Doug:?
Stressed out. That’s a bit more informal. Are you stressed out? I’m feeling
stressed out today.
Stressful. Do you have a stressful job?

talking about their jobs were quite stressed. Perhaps they were in a hurry.
Perhaps they were late for work.

Which of these jobs is considered to be the most stressful job?
Is it
a) a broadcaster
b) a teacher
c) a pilot
It was a tricky quiz today.
Jackie: Yes it was and I guessed teacher, but I imagine they can all be stressful at some
time.
Doug: Yes but I think most people would say that B, a teacher , is the most stressful
job, because if you’re a pilot …yes, even though a pilot and perhaps a
broadcaster – those jobs can be stressful, surveys say that a teacher is the most
stressful job. Big responsibility – you’re taking care of lots of students.

Dieting

Doug: Hello, I’m Doug Campbell and this is 6 minute English. Today we’re talking
about going on a diet. And I’m here with Jackie Dalton.
Jackie: Hi Doug, have you ever gone on a diet to try to lose weight?
Doug: No I haven’t Jackie, but I am sure if I did go on a diet, I wouldn’t be successful.
It’s very, very difficult! To start the programme I have a question for you
though, Jackie, about going on a diet. Well there are lots of different diets –
loads of different diets, but I want to talk about one of them – the low-carb diet.
Jackie: Yes, I’ve heard of that.
Doug: Okay Jackie, if you were on a low-carb diet, you would eat…
a) less pasta
b) less fish
c) less salad
Jackie: Okay, yes, I think I do know this one because low-carb is short for lowcarbohydrate
which is a food group that releases lots of energy and I know that
fish is protein, salad is roughage, which is leafy stuff, and pasta is a
carbohydrate so if you are eating low-carb you would cut out or cut down on
pasta.
Doug: Okay, you are sure about that.
Jackie: I’m sure about that. Today, we’re going to hear from two people who have
gone a diet. Were they successful? Did they lose weight?

Man
I went on the 28 day detox diet which really helped you lose weight and detox the body at the
same time and it really worked. You just ate hardly anything at all.
Jackie: Hmm. I don’t think I would like that diet.
Doug: Well he said that he did lose weight and also it was a detox diet. That’s when
you eat and drink things that…it’s hard to explain...clean you inside. Fresh
things. Water can be part of a detox diet
Jackie: You won’t gain weight drinking water.
Doug: Gain weight – that’s the opposite of lose weight. And with that detox diet, he
did lose weight.
Jackie: And if you eat less you certainly will lose weight. He said that he ate hardly
anything at all!
Doug: I don’t like the sound of that diet!
Jackie: When you go on a diet you need to be strong. You mustn’t say, “Oh I’ll start
my diet…tomorrow!” Yes, you need a lot of will-power.
Doug: Right, you can eat some things but maybe not the things you like. There is no
such thing as a chocolate cake diet for instance …unfortunately! You’re
listening to BBC Learning English.com.
Doug: Here’s another diet. Listen to this woman. Was her diet successful? Did it work?
Woman

Page 3 of 5
When I was in my twenties I went on a diet where you were only allowed to drink liquids and
it worked. It worked for a week. I lost 6 pounds and then over the weekend I just ate normally
again. And by Monday morning I put all the weight back on again and so it was completely
pointless.
Doug: Oh dear, that diet didn’t work.
Jackie: Yes, she said it was a waste of time. It was completely pointless.
Doug: Well it worked….for a week! But that’s the problem with diets. You lose
weight but then you often put the weight back on.
Jackie: And again, that diet sounded awful, if not unhealthy. She could only drink
liquids.
Doug: According to experts you can’t just go on a diet for a couple of weeks and
expect to keep that weight off. You need to change what you eat permanently.
You have to change your lifestyle.
Jackie: And of course you should always get the advice of your doctor before you do
this kind of thing. And they might suggest you eat different foods. Stay away
from fattening foods like cakes and chips.
Doug: All the foods we like.
Jackie: All the foods we like!
Doug: You can get more advice on this from the BBC Website in an article called
“How to Lose Weight”.
Jackie: Let’s look again at some of the language about diets. You can gain weight or….

Doug: You can lose weight. Many people go on a diet to try to lose weight. They go
on a diet to try to lose weight, but it doesn’t always work.
Jackie: No the diet doesn’t work – they don’t lose any weight. Or they lose the weight
and then they put it back on again.
Jackie: Listen again to those two people talking about their diets.
Diets
I went on the 28 day detox diet which really helped you lose weight and detox the body at the
same time and it really worked. You just ate hardly anything at all.
When I was in my twenties I went on a diet where you were only allowed to drink liquids and
it worked. It worked for a week. I lost 6 pounds and then over the weekend I just ate normally
again. And by Monday morning I put all the weight back on again and so it was completely
pointless.
Doug: Finally, my question Jackie.
Jackie: Yes, the one I was so sure I had the correct answer to.
Doug: If you were on a low-carb diet you would eat?
a) less pasta
b) less fish
c) less salad
Jackie: And I said less pasta. Was I right?
Doug: You were absolutely correct. I love pasta though.
Jackie: No, I don’t think I could ever do a low-carb diet. It would never work.

Doug: Well, it certainly wouldn’t for me. Okay the answer was a) less pasta. If you
were on a low-carb diet you would eat less pasta. That’s all for now. Goodbye.
Jackie: Goodbye.///////22 BBC Learning English

Doug: Hello, I’m Doug Campbell and this is 6 Minute English. Today we’re talking
about mobile phones. And I’m here with Jackie Dalton – have you got your
mobile Jackie?
Jackie: Yes, I have Doug – but I’ve turned it off… for six minutes.
Doug: Okay. Well we don’t want your phone ringing during the programme.
Mobile phones are so popular nowadays. And I have a question for you before
we start…okay?
Jackie: Okay.
Doug: In Britain we call it a mobile phone. In Canada and the United States they
call it a different name. Which of these names is not a name for a mobile phone
in Canada?
a) a cell phone
b) a cellular phone
c) a c phone
Jackie: That’s quite tricky. I thought it was going be easier than that!
Definitely a cell phone is a name. Cellular phone sounds a bit odd, but I think
you could say it. C phone I’ve never heard before so I’ll go with c phone.
Doug: Okay, well we will check your answer later in the programme. Now here’s
another question - I asked people in the office about mobile phones and I asked:
Could you live without your mobile phone?

Nooooo! I couldn’t live without my mobile phone. It organises everything I do in work and in
my private life.
I could live without my mobile phone because I think it encourages me to make unnecessary
phone calls.
Doug: For some people a mobile phone is very important.
Jackie: Yes, that woman said, “I couldn’t live without my mobile phone.”
Doug: Yes, for her it’s not just a phone. It organises everything she does in work and
in her private life.
Jackie: Her private life and that’s everything that she does outside of work. Her home
life.
Doug: Right, so she can’t live without her mobile but the man - he didn’t think it
was important.
Jackie: Yes, he thought that he would make more phone calls…because he was
carrying a mobile. But maybe he didn’t really need to make a phone call.
Doug: By the way you’ll notice that we say to make a phone call. Why do we say that?
Why do we make a phone call? I don’t know – do you Jackie?
Jackie: No, I don’t know. It’s strange, isn’t it?
Doug: Yes, it’s weird.
Jackie: Because to make is usually to do with to create or something like that, but we
just say to make a phone call.

Doug: There’s something else about mobile phones. I’m thinking about text messages.
Jackie: Yeah and I actually use text messages much more than phoning people.
Doug: But this word text – t.e.x.t. - a noun. I will send you a text. But nowadays, it’s
a verb. I will text you. Text me.
You’re listening to BBC Learning English.com
Okay, let’s hear some answers to that question – Could you live without your
mobile phone?
Staff
Yes, yes, I could easily live without my mobile phone. Useful to have around- I don’t miss it
when it’s turned off.
I couldn’t live without my mobile phone and in fact if I accidentally leave it at home I feel
really lost without it and I would go back and get it.
Doug: Okay Jackie, first that man - he doesn’t care about his mobile.
Jackie: Yes, it’s useful he says but he doesn’t think about it when it’s turned off – he
doesn’t miss it.
Doug: But when you leave it at home – that’s different. The woman said that she
would go back if she left hers behind. And I have to say, I probably would as
well. What about you Jackie?
Jackie: I think if I was leaving home to go to work, I would. But if I was going for a
walk or something, I absolutely love leaving it behind because it means I won’t
be bothered at all.
Doug: Actually, I’ve left mine at home today and I don’t like that one bit.

Doug: And that woman said she would feel lost without her mobile phone.
Most people like to be contactable – they want to know that people can phone
them. And when I go out I like to say, “I’m ON my mobile. I’m on my
mobile.”
Jackie: Now we’ve been talking about texting with your mobile and there’s a whole
new language with texting of course.
Doug: Yes, you want to write quickly and so you make shorter words.
For example, a text message that has the letter u in it. What does that mean
Jackie?
Jackie: Well, the letter u means you as in y.o.u. – me and you.
Doug: Okay, and if I write pls…pls… What does that mean?
Jackie: Well that means please – pls – please.
Doug: Okay and the number 2 - that’s easy – it means to – t.o. or too – t.o.o. Me
too.
The letter r – what does that mean Jackie?
Jackie: That means are are - a.r.e. And so the message – Where are you? – becomes –
where – then the letter r – then the letter u. Where r u?
Doug: Where r u?
Text messages – that’s one use for a mobile phone. Let’s listen again to people
talking about their mobiles.
Jackie: They are answering the question – Could you live without your mobile?
